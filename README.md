# Container ship storage program

This repository contains my laboratory works on the programming course at my university. The task for the laboratory works was to write program for storing objects (in my case, the objects are representing by the container ships). Program and GUI for this task was written using C# and Windows Forms. Each laboratory work represents improved state of the project (see the contents of the branches of this project).
